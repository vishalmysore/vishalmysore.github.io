            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
               With over 20 years of experience in software development and leadership, I have had the privilege of working across a diverse range of industries, from financial services to cutting-edge technology, driving impactful solutions with a focus on microservices, AI, DevOps, and chaos engineering.

Currently, I serve as a Director at Citi, where I lead the engineering and validation of AI-powered cloud-native platforms for low-latency financial applications, leveraging Kubernetes/OpenShift and a variety of modern technologies. My expertise spans across DevOps, automation, environment management, and containerization, with a particular focus on optimizing production environments for resilience and efficiency. I spearhead the design of Zero Touch Deployments, Auto Checkouts, and advanced monitoring solutions, which significantly enhance delivery speed and reduce manual interventions.

Previously, I held the position of Senior Vice President at Citi, where I led a globally distributed team in developing innovative solutions in the areas of chaos engineering, containerization, cloud migration, and DevOps automation. My team and I were responsible for ensuring the resilience of financial systems, optimizing performance, and integrating the latest advancements in machine learning and AI to transform operations.

I have extensive experience in managing large teams, driving digital transformation, and mentoring the next generation of technology leaders. I am passionate about building robust, scalable systems and continuously learning and experimenting with new technologies to solve complex challenges.

In my career, I’ve contributed to a wide array of initiatives, including developing stock record systems, creating machine learning prototypes for predictive analytics, and leading the development of online banking applications for CIBC. My deep technical knowledge is complemented by my ability to innovate, manage cross-functional teams, and lead with a focus on delivering measurable business value.

When I’m not immersed in technology, I enjoy working on open-source projects, mentoring aspiring professionals, and exploring the latest trends in AI and machine learning.

            <h2>Detecting Network Operation Validation Anomalies in Conglomerate-Application-Based Ecosystems Systems and Methods</h2>
            <p><strong>Patent Number:</strong> 11,924,027</p>
            <p><strong>Date of Patent:</strong> March 5, 2024</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Systems and methods for reducing wasted computational resources by detecting network operation validation anomalies in conglomerate-application-based ecosystems. The system provides a first network operation to a software application, receives a message associated with the processing, performs a validation process, and prevents invalid operations from propagating.</p>
